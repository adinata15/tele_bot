Bot to lessen effort to keep track of stock watchlist:
- Give periodic reports for companies that is under the watchlist
- Provide basic information of compnaies based on stock code given
- User needs to register for the bot to work (so far only my username is registered :smile:)

Limitations:
- Data obtained from Yahoo finance so the companies are quite limited :sad:
- Data is obtained at the fastest rate of 1 minute (although not sure if this is applicable to all stocks or only for more well-known stocks)

To run:
python bot.py devel
